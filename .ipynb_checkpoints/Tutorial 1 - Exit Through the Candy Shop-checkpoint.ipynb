    "We will begin our journey on Oxford Street in central London, a street that until recently was regarded as the cities premier shopping destination, which over the past two years has seen the opening of a suprising number of American sweet shops to the dislike of many citizens and local authorities. The shops have attracted negative attention for a number of reasons including extortionate prices, out of date/counterfeit products and opaque finances that have led Westminster council to claim they are [overdue £7.9 million](https://www.ft.com/candy) in business rates from 30 sweet shops in the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Kingdom of Sweets* is one store in particular that came under scrutiny recently for unpaid taxes. The [mysterious owner](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/officers/Nd2URspq4bvLy-hwzDZ0_p7FGJw/appointments) of the business has a prolific record of directing many companies that fended off compulsary strike-offs and [failed to pay millions in business rates](https://www.ft.com/content/3d338904-6036-4326-a786-971464907f14). This questionable business owner will serve as the input to our hunt to find other individuals."
